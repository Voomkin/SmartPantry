# Smart Pantry User Manual and System Manual
Thank you using our Smart Pantry application. In this guide, you will find the User Manual and the System Manual for our application. The User Manual explains how to use the app, and is intended to act as a reference for users who would like to familiarize themselves with a feature of the application. The System Manual shows all the functions used throughout the application, and is intended to act as a reference for programmers who would like to understand how the app works under the hood.

The Smart Pantry app was created by the following students in the LANE department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at West Virginia University:
- Shannon Biega
- Kollin Labowski
- Jonathan Malcomb
- Ryan Mraz
- Matthew Winston

### Documentation of Testing

### Architecture Diagram

The architecture used is based off of AWS Amplify. React Native is the JavaScript library used to develop for both Android and iOS devices, AWS S3 provides a storage solution, AWS Cognito provides authentication for the app, and AWS AppSync creates a GraphQL endpoint to interact with AWS DynamoDB as the backend database.
