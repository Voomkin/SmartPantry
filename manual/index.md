# Smart Pantry User Manual and System Manual
Thank you using our Smart Pantry application. In this guide, you will find the User Manual and the System Manual for our application. The User Manual explains how to use the app, and is intended to act as a reference for users who would like to familiarize themselves with a feature of the application. The System Manual shows all the functions used throughout the application, and is intended to act as a reference for programmers who would like to understand how the app works under the hood.

The Smart Pantry app was created by the following students in the LANE department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at West Virginia University:
- Shannon Biega
- Kollin Labowski
- Jonathan Malcomb
