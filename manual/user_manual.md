### Create Account
Creating an account is the first step you will want to take upon downloading your Smart Pantry app. Creating an account will allow you to access all of the Smart Pantry's features, including creating and accessing your pantry. Once you have downloaded the app, you should see a screen that looks like the below screenshot:

<img src="./images/createaccount1.jpg" height="500px" width="250px"></img>

Notice the **Sign Up** button in the lower right of the screen (pictured above). Click this button to navigate to a new page that looks like the image below. On this screen, enter a username, password, email address, and a phone number. There are a few things to note here. First, the chosen username must be in the form of an email address (see example in the picture). It is recommended that you use the same email for your username and email address. For you password, we recommend using at least 12 characters, and a mixture of upper/lower case letters, numbers, and symbols (although this is not enforced). Ensure that the phone number you enter is a valid phone number (must be 10 characters long). When you are satisfied with the information you have entered, click the confirm button (pictured below).

Now that you have entered your new login information, you should receive a confirmation code at the email address you have specified. If you do not receive a confirmation code within about a minute, you can send another one by clicking **Resend code** in the bottom left of the screen. An example code is shown in the image below. You should enter your username again and enter your confirmation code, and click the **Confirm** button when you are done.

If you have followed all of the steps, your new account will be created and you will be redirected to the **Sign in** page.

Once you have created an account, you are ready to log in and start to explore your Smart Pantry. If you have not logged in yet, you should be greeted by a sign in page once you log in that looks like the image below. Simply enter the username and password you used when you created your account, and click the **SIGN IN** button.

### Create Pantry
When you first create an account, the first thing you will probably want to do is make a pantry. Making a pantry allows you to add items and keep track of them, but it also gives you access to other features, such as the **Shopping List** and **Notifications**. In order to create a pantry, first open up the drawer in the top left corner (see **Navigating the App**). Select the option which reads **My Pantry**:

This will bring you to a page that looks like the following image (if you haven't already created a pantry). Select the **Create Pantry** button to create your pantry.

Next, choose a name for your pantry an type it into the input field that appears. When you have selected a name you are satisfied with, click **Submit**.
