### Create Account
Creating an account is the first step you will want to take upon downloading your Smart Pantry app. Creating an account will allow you to access all of the Smart Pantry's features, including creating and accessing your pantry. Once you have downloaded the app, you should see a screen that looks like the below screenshot:

Notice the **Sign Up** button in the lower right of the screen (pictured above). Click this button to navigate to a new page that looks like the image below. On this screen, enter a username, password, email address, and a phone number. There are a few things to note here. First, the chosen username must be in the form of an email address (see example in the picture). It is recommended that you use the same email for your username and email address. For you password, we recommend using at least 12 characters, and a mixture of upper/lower case letters, numbers, and symbols (although this is not enforced). Ensure that the phone number you enter is a valid phone number (must be 10 characters long). When you are satisfied with the information you have entered, click the confirm button (pictured below).

Now that you have entered your new login information, you should receive a confirmation code at the email address you have specified. If you do not receive a confirmation code within about a minute, you can send another one by clicking **Resend code** in the bottom left of the screen. An example code is shown in the image below. You should enter your username again and enter your confirmation code, and click the **Confirm** button when you are done.
